# malaria_cell_classification

In this amazing project that we did under the guidance of prof. Haitham Amar (ECE prof, in UOW), our main goal was to create an DL/ML algorithm which can detect malaria with the least False-Positives while classification. 

In this project we had malaria cell images (infected and un-infected) and we had to classify the image correctly using ML/DL. To solve this issue we were able to get amazing result with the help of Custom Convolutional Neural Networks and image pre-processing. In the image pre-processing we applied filter to the image so that only the Region of Interest of the image (malaria infected cell part) can be seen in the pre-processed. After that we fed the pre-processed image in the Custom CNN that we have created using trial and error method and we were able to get 99.8 percent accuracy on the dataset which is even better then the best accuracy in the published literature.

So we are trying to publish our paper right now for the malaria detection. Enjoy :)
